Easily get flanking nucleotides and annotation for HM450 probes interactively. 

NEWS: 
5/24/17 - Planned updates:
1. Create a temporary default file that is rewriteable and revertable to initial default from download.
2. Add options to search EPIC array CpGs. 
3. Add options to search nearest flanking CpG probes (as opposed to just flanking sequence) and/or detect whether flanking sequence contains CpG probes (check across platforms).
